    Annoying experience dealing with container height.
    max-height only works if the parent has a height value explicitly set. This does not include max-height.

    Praise Mozilla's explanation:
        The percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the generated box's containing block. If the height
        of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is
        not absolutely positioned, the percentage value is treated as none.



    At this time we seem to have an operational albeit ugly 'settings' page with commensurate server functionality
    The layout of the components doesn't feel great. Need to spend some time considering optimal layouts.
    Peeling out API calls into their own folder is appealing.
