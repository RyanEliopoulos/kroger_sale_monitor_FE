    Need to clarify what sort of implicit casting is happening between ints and strings in JSON.stringify and
    server side stuff.


    Page refresh: Addressed page refreshes by altering the app's routes. All valid routes render the landing page
    initially. The landing page then updates the store.refreshed variable, causing App.js to re-render the routes
    using the real components.


    build_script.sh: Need to update the build script to set the Router basename value.

    Deploying a react app outside of the root directory requires extra care.  <Router> Needs a 'basename' property set
    and potentially changing any hardcoded route values. 'homepage' in package.json must also be updated.

    React Router with useRoutes
        <Router>
           {element}
        </Router>


      Didn't work. But pulling Router to the parent component, then return <>{element}</> Did. But whyyyy

    Default div display (block) defaults to width: 100%. inline causes width to shrink to content.

    Kroger API will sometimes return products that have no pricing information. Patched by setting undefined prices
    to 0.

    GET requests do not have a body. Any 'args' need to be included in the query string instead.

    for..in not the way to go with Arrays.

    Probably want normal for loops rather than nesting all these array.forEach calls.


    The CSS sizing the cards in ProductSearch feels like a house of cards. But it looks good on my computer!

    Annoying experience dealing with container height.
    max-height only works if the parent has a height value explicitly set. This does not include max-height.

    Praise Mozilla's explanation:
        The percentage is calculated with respect to the height of the generated box's containing block. If the height
        of the containing block is not specified explicitly (i.e., it depends on content height), and this element is
        not absolutely positioned, the percentage value is treated as none.



    At this time we seem to have an operational albeit ugly 'settings' page with commensurate server functionality
    The layout of the components doesn't feel great. Need to spend some time considering optimal layouts.
    Peeling out API calls into their own folder is appealing.
